# 5023Y-intro-to-linear-models

Lesson 1: learning to calculate the mean, SD, SE and the central limit theorem. Learned how to present the data and new statistical variables that we calculated, for instance using a tabel or on a normal distribution curve. We then calculated confidence intervals to say how much confience we could agree or disagree with a hypothesis. 

Lesson 2: learning how to use lsmodel to form visual representations of our statistical analysis.

Lesson 3: In this lesson we learnt how to calculate P-values and test statistical significance for our experiments using linear models. We also compared the linear model structures for producing a paired vs. unpaired t-test. We also learned to appreciate the potential issues around making Type 1 and Type 2 errors, and how an appreciation of confidence intervals and standardised effect sizes can be used to assess these. We then looked at repeatability and how reporting estimates and confidence intervals allows us to report our levels of uncertainty, and provides results which are more informative for comparitive studies. 

Lesson 5: In this lesson we learnt how to use ANOVA to create tables that show the degrees of freedom, sum of squares, mean sum of squares, and the F statistic. We then used the F-value given in the ANOVA table to calculate the P-value using the F-value and degrees of freedom. Then gave an example of a good write up using the F-value and P-value. We then learnt how to use two-way ANOVA tables which includes 2 explanatory variables. 

Lesson 6: In this lesson we looked at multivariate linear models. We learnt that when models have significant interaction effects you must always consider the main terms even if they are not significant by themselves
